# steam-play-time
Display the play time of a subset of your steam friends and see what games they have been collectively playing

This requires that you have a (free) steam API key in order to make the requests
At the top of the file there is a section for configuration. Enter in your steam API Key.

For each friend, enter in their 64 bit steam ID where "Example" or "Example2" are. Add their name to the 'targets' array, and add in their name into the 'targetNames' array with quotes around their name. You are now set to go.

This requires Python 2.
